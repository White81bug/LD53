  - I have always dreamt about Mars. The red dot in the vast skies promised a better
    future for humankind and myself. When the opportunity arose, I jumped at the
    chance. Leaving all my life behind - old friends, ex-lovers. An adult daughter.
    The call of wanderlust was too strong to resist.
  - 'Life on Mars is not a goddamn sci-fi show. There are no pretty domes in the
    red valleys and no happy people building a better future for the next generations.
    Here is your first disappointment: you must live six feet under the ground as
    if it were your grave. You don''t see the sun, you don''t see the stars. You
    are buried alive in this twisted idea of a space dream. '
  - 'My daughter''s name is Agatha. She is Earthbound. The mere thought of leaving
    our home planet is repulsive to her. I have been waiting to hear from her for
    nearly a decade. Does she have a family of her own? What does she do? Where does
    she live? What person did she grow up to? I wish I could see her one more time. '
  - 'Rangers tell stories. About pyramids of the Ophir Chasma and shrieks of the
    Noctis Labyrinth. About the giant bones found in the Eberswalde Crater. About
    the Mars Mission Zero sent by the USSR back in the seventies. But Mars is stillborn,
    isn''t it? Dry and dead, never having a chance to prosper.  '
  - People disappear on the Red Planet. Three went to the Noctis Labyrinth, and no
    one returned. We haven't found bodies. Only one broken helmet is half-buried
    in the red sand. And so many died in accidents. Food poisoning, suffocation,
    broken bones, and untreated diseases. Mars is reaping its bloody harvest while
    people sacrifice themselves in the name of empty ideals.
  - 'I am filled with ambition. Though wealth cannot be gained on Mars, the chance
    to etch one''s name in the everlasting hall of fame awaits. From the first human
    in space, Yuri Gagarin, to the present day, many pioneers have left Earth and
    made their mark. I yearned to join their ranks and be remembered as a conqueror
    of Mars. To have my name enshrined in the pages of student books, to become a
    symbol on which humanity can build its future in space.   '
  - '"Johansson, do you copy? Listen, I hate being this person, but someone has to
    tell you. Agatha, your daughter, died. I am sorry." '
  - Mars will never be the second Earth. It was all a lie, wishful thinking. It was
    too late when we realized it. That red dust will never become fertile soil. The
    air will never become breathable. Mars will never be terraformed. All these people
    died for nothing. I wasted my life on nothing.
  - '"The colonization of Mars is aborted. All remaining explorers will be returned
    to Earth. Refrain from taking equipment. Leave it be." '
  - I hate Mars.
